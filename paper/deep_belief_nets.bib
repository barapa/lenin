In this thesis I implement and evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models and using these as building blocks I investigate the hypothesis that predicting the time-to-time sensory input is a good learning objective. I introduce the Predictive Encoder (PE) and show that a simple non-regularized learning rule, minimizing prediction error on natural video patches leads to receptive fields similar to those found in Macaque monkey visual area V1. I scale this model to video of natural scenes by introducing the Convolutional Predictive Encoder (CPE) and show similar results. Both models can be used in deep architectures as a deep learning module."
